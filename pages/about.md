## About the Collection

This site is generated using [CollectionBuilder-GH](https://collectionbuilding.github.io/gh/), a project to create a free and simple digital collection using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) from: 

- a CSV of collection metadata
- a folder of JPG images

This specific site was developed on 3/10/24 by Johnny Shanahan as a demo for an LSIS 5830 assignment. It contains still images of his discs and does not represent his current disc collection (two of these are now at the bottom of a lake). The purpose of this collection is to document art found on disc golf discs- its potential users are anyone interested in the question of whether or not this constitutes art in any meaningful way, or mere branding. Each disc has specific flight properties that aren't necessarily reflected in the disc name (at least not in any way I can tell).
