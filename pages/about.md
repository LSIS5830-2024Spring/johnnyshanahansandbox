## About the Collection

This site is generated using [CollectionBuilder-GH](https://collectionbuilding.github.io/gh/), a project to create a free and simple digital collection using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) from: 

- a CSV of collection metadata
- a folder of JPG images

This specific site was developed on 3/10/24 by Johnny Shanahan as a demo for an LSIS 5830 assignment. It will not be updated in the future.
